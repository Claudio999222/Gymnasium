# Gymnasium Basics

## Overview

This notebook provides an introduction to the basics of Gymnasium, an open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. Gymnasium provides a wide range of environments that users can interact with to test and train reinforcement learning agents.

## Key Components:

1. **Environments**: Gymnasium offers a variety of environments, ranging from classic control problems to Atari 2600 games, designed for reinforcement learning experimentation.

2. **Agent Interaction**: Users can interact with environments by taking actions and observing the resulting states and rewards.

3. **Observations**: Environments provide observations as states, allowing the agent to perceive the current state of the environment.

4. **Actions**: Agents can take actions in the environment, and the environment responds with the next state and a reward signal.

## Gymnasium Workflow:

1. **Environment Initialization**: Creating an instance of a Gymnasium environment.

2. **Observing the Initial State**: Obtaining the initial observation (state) from the environment.

3. **Agent-Environment Interaction**: Iteratively taking actions, observing the next state, and receiving rewards.

4. **Episode Termination**: Episodes end based on specific conditions in the environment.

## Application:

- **Reinforcement Learning Research**: Gymnasium is widely used for benchmarking and testing new reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **Algorithm Development**: Researchers and developers use Gymnasium to implement and test their reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **Education**: Gymnasium is valuable for educational purposes, allowing students to experiment with reinforcement learning concepts.

## Demonstration:

This notebook serves as an introduction to using Gymnasium for reinforcement learning experimentation. Key steps include:

1. **Environment Selection**: Choosing a Gymnasium environment for experimentation.

2. **Interaction with the Environment**: Interacting with the environment by taking actions and observing the resulting states and rewards.

3. **Observation and Action Spaces**: Understanding the observation and action spaces of the chosen environment.

4. **Rendering**: Visualizing the environment to observe agent behavior.

This demonstration provides a starting point for users interested in exploring and experimenting with reinforcement learning using Gymnasium.
